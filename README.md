# About VMProtect

VMProtect is a software protection utility that secures executable code against reverse engineering, analysis, and hacking by virtualizing and obfuscating parts of the program code. VMProtect uses virtualization by transforming selected segments of program code into an entirely new set of commands, which are then executed by a custom virtual machine embedded within the protected application. 

It supports platforms such as Windows, macOS, and works with various programming languages including C/C++, Delphi, Visual Basic, and more. The tool offers mutation and code obfuscation, injecting random, confusing code paths and "dead" operations, making it harder for attackers to analyze.

VMProtect also provides licensing and activation systems, enabling software vendors to lock features to hardware, serial numbers, or set upgrade limits.
